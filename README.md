# 📊 Sales Analysis & Customer Churn Prediction

## 📝 Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning project divided into two main modules:
1.  **Sales Performance Analysis**: A deep dive into revenue trends, regional performance, and top-selling products.
2.  **Customer Churn Prediction**: A machine learning pipeline designed to predict customer attrition and identify key risk factors.

This project demonstrates **production-grade Python code**, featuring modular functions, Scikit-Learn pipelines, and automated data visualizations.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the source CSV files (`sales_data.csv`, `customer_churn.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks containing the analysis.
- `analysis_report.md`: Detailed summary of findings and methodology.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For efficient data manipulation and vectorization.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For generating professional insights dashboards.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For building the Logistic Regression pipeline and feature engineering.
